Unfortunately, even after 2 years in the industry and 6 years in school, I am still an average programmer, if not below that.

I only made this repo to practice CTCI questions for future interviews, and to let people know I know how to use git. The algos
and problems I solve here are probably going to be far from perfect, but I appreciate any constructive criticism.
